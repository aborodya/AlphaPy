## Github
We use Github to host our code, to track both issues and feature requests, and also accept pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase ([Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)).

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Add tests if possible.
3. If you've changed an API, update the RST documentation.
4. Run your code through lint.
5. Issue the pull request.
